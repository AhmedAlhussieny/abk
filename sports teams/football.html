        <p><h2>It is very difficult to say which is the best football team in the world. The argument will never be settled, nor is there a definite answer.

            The debate can never stop, and the different factions will never agree because football cannot be truly, definitively conquered by a team.
            
            But for this post, TOPSOCCERBLOGs criteria for selecting the best teams revolves around current standing in domestic and continental competitions. Also taken into account is the strength of leagues and tournaments.</h2></p>
